# Image Guidance Lab – Structural Data Processing Pipelines

This repository contains the code developed during my 2-month internship at the Image Guidance Lab (IGL) at Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin, focused on DWI neuroimaging data processing.

## Folder Structure:

`igl_code/`
The original implementation of the processing pipelines. These scripts were developed before adopting the BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure) format and may follow custom directory conventions.

`j_code_home/`
The most up-to-date version of the pipelines, fully adapted to the BIDS format. Includes minor improvements and refactoring over the original code in `igl_code`.

For detailed instructions on how to run the pipeline, please refer to the README inside the `j_code_home/` folder
