1. Make sure to install all required software packages (e.g., MRtrix, ANTs, FSL, TractSeg, etc.) must be installed
2. Python version must be <= 3.11 for proper functioning with MRtrix outdated (include version here) "imp" module,
this can be achieved my creating and activating a py311 conda environment
3. After activating conda env, execute main_first_pipe.py from terminal located in the same directory
4. The command expects a --root argument to study subjects directory,
example: python3 main_first_pipe.py --root "/media/nas/nikita/test_study"
